**AWS edge locations -** cache items like images, videos, and other resources, so that users can access the content they need with lower latency.

**CloudFormation -** help automate the deployment of your cloud resources. These services use infrastructure as code, or IaC, helping you achieve a consistent, reliable set up

When choosing an AWS Region, consider these key factors:

- **Compliance and data governance**: Ensure the Region meets legal and regulatory requirements for data residency and sovereignty.

- **Proximity to customers**: Select a Region close to your users to minimize latency and improve application performance.

- **Available services**: Not all AWS services are available in every Region, so verify that the services you need are supported.

- **Pricing**: Costs vary by Region due to factors like local infrastructure and operational expenses.

**Route 53 -** Domain Naming System(DNS)

**Amazon CloudFront** is a content delivery network (CDN) service that caches and distributes content like images, videos, and other resources across a global network of edge locations. This allows users to access content with lower latency by serving it from locations closer to them.

**CloudFormation -** a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources, allowing you to spend less time on management and more time on your applications. With CloudFormation, you define your infrastructure as code(**IaC)** using templates that describe the AWS resources you need, and CloudFormation handles the provisioning and configuration for you.

Eg Scenario for this : A rapidly growing tech startup company is planning to launch a new web  
application that will require a complex infrastructure setup, including multiple Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling groups. The application must be deployed consistently across different environments.
