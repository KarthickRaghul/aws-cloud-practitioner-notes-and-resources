> **My Experience**:
>   
> I got a score of 914 by learning through AWS SkillBuilder's **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials** , Took Notes , learned from them and finally took practice tests before writing the original exam. Practiced Strongly for two days before exam .  Some of the questions were direct questions and some scenario based questions .My exam had questions about **AWS CAF** (Which I felt a bit confusing 🫩) . Around 10-12 questions repeated from the mock test that I took . I never paid anything for the Practice exams and the test I provided below are also free .
